Allmaps is a set of [open source tools](https://github.com/allmaps) that make it easier and more fun to search, explore, georeference and work with collections of digitized maps.

**Allmaps works with any image repository that supports the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (IIIF).**
