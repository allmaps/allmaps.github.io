# Allmaps.org

Allmaps is a set of [open source tools](https://github.com/allmaps) that make it easier and more fun to search, explore, georeference and work with collections of digitised maps.

**Allmaps works with any image repository that supports the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (IIIF).**

All components rely on a simple JSON metadata structure that holds information about each map’s control points and mask. This metadata structure anticipates the upcoming JSON schema prepared by the [IIIF Community](https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps-tsg/), and is based on W3C’s [Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) specification. Please refer to the [IIIF Map Collections](https://github.com/bertspaan/iiif-map-collections#georeference-annotations) repository for exemplary data.

Allmaps and its components are far from finished. For now, you can explore the following parts:

*   [Allmaps viewer](https://viewer.allmaps.org/)
*   [Allmaps editor](https://allmaps.org/editor)
*   [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/allmaps)
*   [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@bertspaan/iiif-maps)
